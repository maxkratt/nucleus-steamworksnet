# Voice Chat

Push to talk over Steam voice: hold V, and Steam records and compresses your voice; each chunk goes out as an unreliable Nucleus call on your player's object, the server relays it to the other players, and each of them decompresses it and plays it on your capsule's `AudioSource`. A capsule lights up green, and a speaking icon shows over its name tag, while its player talks.

## Requirements

- Nucleus, Steamworks.NET and the Input System package.
- The Shared sample (it holds `SteamBootstrap`), imported beside this one.
- Steam running and logged in, a microphone Steam can use (Steam > Settings > Voice), and `steam_appid.txt` (480 for testing) in the project folder, or beside the executable in a build.

## Setup

1. Open `Scenes/SteamVoiceChat.unity`.
2. Open **Tools > Nucleus**, and on its Build tab press **Rebuild** beside Rebuild Network Prefab Collection once, so `VoiceChatPlayer` is registered.

## Testing with two accounts

1. On the first machine, press Play (or run a build) and press **Host**, then **Copy my SteamID** and send it to the second account.
2. On the second machine, logged into another Steam account, paste the SteamID and press **Join**.
3. Hold V on either machine and talk: the other machine hears you and sees your capsule light up and the speaking icon over your name. You never hear yourself.

## What to look at

- `VoiceChatPlayer.SendRecordedVoice`: `SteamUser.GetAvailableVoice` and `GetVoice`, then `TrySendRpc(RpcTarget.Observers, Channel.Unreliable, ...)`. Unreliable because a lost chunk is a short gap, while a resent one arrives too late to play.
- `VoiceChatPlayer.OnVoiceReceived`: `SteamUser.DecompressVoice` at Steam's optimal sample rate into a one second ring that a streamed `AudioClip` plays from, gathering 0.1 s before it starts so uneven arrival does not stutter. A dedicated server only relays.
- Voice is not positional: set the `AudioSource` spatial blend on the prefab to make it so.
- `VoiceChatPanel` is the Quick Start panel (host, join by SteamID, leave), so this sample needs nothing but Shared.
